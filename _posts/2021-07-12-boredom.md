# Boredom - the mother of invention

Growing up I was told that "necessity is the mother of invention." It was the kind of thing you would hear as your dad sharpened a twig around the campfire to 'make do' for the missing knife that wasn't packed. At the time I thought it was great, you can just invent on the fly based on the needs. But as an older, wiser world explorer I must say I've come to a new thought. Boredom is really what makes us create. It brings us to innovate and explore new skills. New worlds, new languages, new vistas of life. But what happens when we stop becoming bored. When every moment that would have been a moment of boredom and seeking what could be done is simply replaced with the brainless reach towards the smartphone and a click and a swipe. We die a little bit every time and another opportunity is missed. An experience that could have been gained vanishes in lieu of yet another Tik-Tok dancer. We mosey on as zombies, consumers instead of creators.
