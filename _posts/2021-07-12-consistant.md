If you have ever dabbled in the world of self-improvement, then you surely may be able to relate to it feeling like relocating Janga blocks. You take a certain area of your life such as fitness and health and begin to do really well, but then you find another area out of balance such as work or reading.So you resolve to read more books only to find that now balancing both working out, and reading is causing you to miss out on your relationships. So you try and rob blocks from somewhere else and find the whole tower crumbling...

But beyond that there is another more sinister fiend to the efforts of improvement. I'm sure this does not impact everyone, but the ones wired like me will be able to relate. That is the monotany of consistancy. For whatever reason, my dopamine riddled brain has a hard time doing the same thing twice when it comes to great habbits. And by the third time I self-destruct. From waking up at 6 AM to eating a vegitarian diet, these things all begin and then soon after end. They end not because I didn't like them, and absolutely not because they should end. But rather they end because I get tired of them. For no other reason than that and I find myself envying the ox that can tread grain day in and day out, and think my how much better it would be. If I could add this elusive thing called consistancy to my day, and even more so to the next day...
